=deck52= is a collection of compact programs, each written in a unique
programming language, with the purpose of generating a standard 52-card deck.

A deck is composed of 52 cards:

- 4 suits: *clubs*, *diamonds*, *hearts*, *spades*
- 13 ranks: *2 - 10*, *jack*, *queen*, *king*, *ace*

* Guidelines
All implementations should be functionally identical, adhering to the following
rules:

*Do's:*
- Include a =main= function to serve as the program's entry
point
- The program should be a single file, with the =main= function
included
- Implement a =genDeck= function to generate a deck of cards
  - Adhere to naming conventions, obviously - The program's output should be a
    *container* of *pair-like* *string-like* elements
- The first *string-like* element represents the card's *rank*
  - The second *string-like* element represents the card's *suit*
  - The container should preferably be unordered - Include a minimal test
    suite; =assert=-ing the size of the deck is sufficient
- Favor a functional programming style over an imperative one
  - Avoid loop constructs, prefer higher-order functions
  - In essence, aim for concise code
- Utilize the most appropriate data structure for the task
  - e.g. a *set* instead of a *list* as deck's cards order is irrelevant

*Do not's:*
- *Shuffle* the deck
  - Instead, use a data structure that is inherently unordered
- Adopt an OOP-oriented approach
  - Avoid classes, structs, etc.
  - Favor simple data structures and functions
